            <h2>Fantasy Premier League: a brief overview</h2>
            <p>
                <a href="https://fantasy.premierleague.com/">Fantasy Premier League</a> 
                (FPL) is a popular mobile and web-based game where a user starts with a Â£100M budget, and picks a squad of fifteen players from the Premier League.
                Different players cost different amounts depending on their past performances or real-world price.
                From these fifteen, the user picks eleven starting players and four substitutes, with constraints such as 1 goalkeeper and minimum 3 defenders. 
                This starting eleven must contain a captain, who earns double points, and a vice-captain, who assumes the captaincy if the captain doesn't play.
                The substitutes on a users bench will come onto the team if one of their starting eleven doesn't play that week, meaning it is important to have a strong bench
                The user earns points based on the performance of their 11 selected players, depending on the positions of these players.
                For example, goalkeepers and defenders earn four points for a clean sheet, and forwards earn four points for scoring a goal.
                All players earn 3 points for an assist and 2 points for playing over 60 minutes.
                Players can also lose points, for yellow and red cards, own goals or missed penalties.
                A full breakdown of points is available <a href="https://www.premierleague.com/news/2174909">here</a> on the Premier League website.
            </p>
            <p>
                Users can use one free transfer per week to buy and sell players, after the free transfer is used they are deducted points for subsequent transfers. 
                These free transfers accumulate up to five if unused. This means that long term planning is an important part of the game, 
                it is a bad idea to buy a player with one easy game then a run of tougher games.
            </p>
            <p>
                Users also have access to what are called 'chips', such as bench boost or assistant manager. 
                These have special functions in the game and each one can generally only be used once a season.
                For example, bench boost makes it so that all fifteen players in a user's squad will earn points, not just the starters.
                Assistant manager allows a user to buy a manager and earn points based on their team's performance, such as winning, drawing, scoring, or keeping a clean sheet.
