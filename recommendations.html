        <div class="indented-block">
            <p>To help pick our in-game team for the next three gameweeks, we can consult Fixture Difficulty Ratings (FDR), 
                which are a way of quantifying, in numerical form, how difficult a match will be for a given team, and consequently how the team can be expected to perform. <br>
                The <a href="https://fantasy.premierleague.com/fixtures/fdr" class="link-purple">Premier League website</a> explains FDR as follows: <br>
            </p>
            <p class="FDR-explained"><b>FDR Explained </b><br>
                The FDR is based on a complex algorithm developed by FPL experts. <br>
                A set of formulas process key Opta data variables, along with each team's home and away form for the past six matches, 
                to generate a rank for the perceived difficulty of each Gameweek opponent. <br>
                The FDR is designed to help FPL managers plan their transfer and team selection strategy. It is reviewed on a weekly basis and updated as the season progresses.
            </p>
            
            <p>Here is a graph showing the FDR of all teams for the next three gameweeks. We can use this to inform our decisions of which players to put on our team.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="centred">

        <div class="indented-block">
            <p>
                Teams with fixtures rated four or higher on the FDR are to be avoided. Looking at the next three gameweeks, 
                it is important to note that Liverpool, Newcastle, Aston Villa, and Crystal Palace all have no matches in Gameweek 29(This is called a "blank gameweek").
                Players from these teams should therefore be avoided, as they will earn zero in-game points in Gameweek 29.
            </p>
            <h3>The following teams have FDR below two for all three of their upcoming matches, as well as having no blank gameweeks:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Bournemouth</li>
                <li>Wolves</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>All players who are suspended or injured should be avoided. Here are the players from these two teams with a 100% chance of playing the next game.</h3>
            <p>
                Adams, Brooks, Cook, Hill, Jebbison, Kerkez, Kluivert, O.Dango, Scott, Semenyo, Sinisterra, Tavernier, Arrizabalaga, J.Araujo, Evanilson, Soler, 
                Johnstone, Aït-Nouri, B.Traore, Dawson, Hee Chan, J.Gomes, José Sá, N.Semedo, S.Bueno, Sarabia, Strand Larsen, Toti, Meupiyou, André, Forbs
            </p><br>
            <p>And here they are graphed by total points versus price, to highlight the best value picks.</p>

        <div class="indented-block">
            <h2>So what players should you buy? Looking first at Bournemouth, there are several good options.</h2>
            <h4><b>Kluivert</b></h4>
            <p>
                If you don't have Kluivert in your team, it's a great time to being him in. 
                As can be seen in the 'Price versus Total Points' graph on the graphs page, Kluivert consistently outperforms his low in-game price tag, 
                amassing 140 total points for only £6.1M. He should be a priority purchase over the next three gameweeks.
            </p>
            <h4><b>Evanilson</b></h4>
            <p>
                Evanilson has recently returned from injury and is expected to be Bournemouth's starting striker for the foreseeable future. 
                He is a good budget striker pick, at only £5.6M. 
                Evanilson's return puts O.Dango's minutes into doubt, he may not see many starts in the future.
            </p>
            <h4><b>Semenyo</b></h4>
            <p>
                A solid option in midfield, although he may now see fewer minutes as injured players return to the Bournemouth squad.
            </p>
            <h4><b>Kerkes</b></h4>
            <p>
                Kerkes has been in good form recently, getting an assist in each of his last 2 gameweeks. 
                With Bournemouth's run of relatively easy matches, he should notch up more points for clean sheets and assists over the next few weeks.
            </p>
            <h4><b>Arrizabalaga</b></h4>
            <p>
                The Bournemouth goalkeeper is on loan from Chelsea, having spent last season in Real Madrid.
                He is one of the best goalkeeper choices right now owing to Bournemouth's kind fixtures.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h2>Moving onto Wolves, where reliable players are harder to come by, especially given that their star player Cunha is serving a suspension following a red card.</h2>
            <h4>Strand Larsen</h4>
            <p>
                Although he is going through a bad run of form, Strand Larsen may still be a good pick, as his club are facing two of the bottom three sides over the next three weeks.
            </p>
            <h4>Aït-Nouri</h4>
            <p>A good defensive option, who should definitely pick up a few points for clean sheets over the next three weeks</p>
            <h4>J.Gomes</h4>
            <p>Gomes is in good form recently, scoring a goal against Fulham two weeks ago. He's not the most reliable player though, so he may be better off on the bench</p>
            <h4>José Sá</h4>
            <p>
                The Wolves goalkeeper recently kept a clean sheet against Bournemouth, who have been a very threatening side recently. 
                This bodes well for his chances of clean sheets against Southampton and Ipswich in the upcoming weeks.
            </p>
            <h3>
                In conclusion, players from Bournemouth and maybe from Wolves are a good choice over the next three weeks. 
                FPL users should buy Kluivert as soon as possible, then Evanilson. 
                After that, Semenyo, Kerkes or Aït-Nouri are all good players to have in your squad.
                Neither goalkeeper is a priority buy, as the variance in goalkeeper points is generally far lower than the variance in outfield player points.
            </h3>
