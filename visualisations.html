                <h2>Goals Scored versus Expected Goals</h2>
                <p>
                    This shows better and worse finishers in the league. A player far above the trendline is an expert at converting chances,
                    their position on the chart means that they have scored more goals than would be expected given the circumstances of their shots and chances.
                    Conversely, players far below the trendline have poor finishing, and have scored fewer goals than they would be expected to, 
                    given the circumstances of their shots and chances.

                <h2>Total Points versus Price</h2>
                <p>
                    This is about FPL in-game data. It shows the best value players in the game, based on their total number of in-game points.
                    A player far above the trendline is outperforming their price tag, while a player far below the trendline is underperforming.

                <h2>Expected versus Actual Goal Involvements for 10 most expensive players</h2>
                <p>
                    This graph is similar to graph 1, but the information also included assists. 
                    Players are ordered from left to right in decreasing order of price.
                    This again shows players who are over- or underperforming based on expected goals and expected assists.
                    As these are the most expensive players in the game, we would expect them to be overperforming, and they all are.

            <div class="visualisation-explanation">
                <h2>Form versus Ownership</h2>
                <p>
                    These are again in-game statistics. 
                    Ownership is the proportion of FPL users who have this player in their in-game squad.
                    Form is the average points-per-match over the last five matches.
                    There is a much weaker correlation between these two than in the other scatter plots,
                    indicating that FPL users are as a whole not very receptive to the performance of players over the short term.
                </p>

                <h2>Total Points (Managers)</h2>
                <p>
                    Managers in FPL obviously work differently to players.
                    Managers score points when their team wins, draws or keeps a clean sheet, and for every goal scored.
                    Managers score more points for beating or drawing with teams ranked far ahead of them in the table.
                    This is why the top managers do not necessarily have the most points, 
                    while managers of lower ranked teams get a huge boost from beating top teams.
